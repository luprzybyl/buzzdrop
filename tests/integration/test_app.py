# Removing placeholder tests as the template logic for empty lists is different
# (it omits the section rather than showing a placeholder message within the section)
# The test_index_logged_in_user_no_files already covers the "no files" scenario by asserting absence of the section.

# Removing the duplicated test_manage_users_page_passwords_not_exposed
# The refined test_manage_users_page_for_admin covers the necessary checks.
